            <p><strong>The beautiful city</strong> is characterised by traditional architecture, a lively bar and entertainment scene, and of course a seemingly infinite amount of places to eat. Dedicate your days to working on your appetite by exploring the narrow laneways studded with hidden eateries, sampling street vendors’ skewers adorned with sizzling meats, or getting lost in a hot bowl of silky udon noodles served in a full bodied broth.</p>
            <p>Regardless of your dietary requirements, there’s an experience fit for every foodie - from settling in to a traditional degustation at a Michelin star restaurant to sampling the freshest sashimi grade tuna at a busy fish market…it won’t take you long to learn why Osaka is known for kuidaore (eating until you drop).  And if you’re feeling a little overwhelmed by choice, the best strategy for finding the tastiest food, is to seek out the place with the longest line of locals.</p>

            <h3>Sushi Wakon</h3>
            <p>This Michelin star sushi stop boasts a menu that changes everyday depending on what produce looks freshest at the fish market. Opt for the omakase menu (a type of meal consisting of dishes selected by the chef)… but be sure to book ahead, the pint-sized eatery only seats 10 people!</p>
            <h3>Jan Jan Yokocho alley</h3>
            <p>After a few minutes wandering through Jan Jan Yokocho alley, you’ll realise why Osaka has a reputation for being one of the best cities for eating. Here the kushikatsu (sizzling meat skewers) cost just over $1 and come with a side of all you can eat cabbage.</p>
            <h3>Hariju Dontonbori</h3>
            <p>Sample some amazing Kobe beef at this legendary Osakan restaurant, which has been serving up soul warming hot pots and sukiyaki for over 100 years. The set meals cost between $80 - $200 depending on the choice of beef, which is available in five grades.</p>
            <h3>Hajime</h3>
            <p>This experimental eatery, named after owner Hajime Yoneda was this year awarded three Michelin stars. The inventive menu is inspired by themes of earth and space, and dishes are almost too beautiful to eat… almost. For those lucky few who can get a table, it’s an unforgettable dining experience.</p>
            <h3>Yoshino Sushi</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1841, Yoshino Sushi has been around long enough to have earned a reputation for serving up serious sushi. Settle in for some oshi-zushi a type of pressed sushi which originated in Osaka, or enjoy a lunch box packed with favourites like vinegar treated mackerel and eel.</p>

              <h3>Okonomiyaki</h3>
              <p>This signature and original Osakan dish derives its name from “okonomi” meaning, “what you like” and they’re not kidding, this savory pancake-like dish is a sort of choose your own adventure food experience where you can pick the flavours and a chef cooks it before your eyes. The flavour choices vary across Japan, but in Osaka the flour based batter is mixed with octopus or prawns, egg and shredded cabbage, then ladled onto a hot grill and served hot topped with sizzling pork belly, dried bonito and mayonnaise.</p>

              <h3>Kushikatsu</h3>
              <p>The bite size skewers of deep fried meat and vegetables were invented in Shinsekai, a district in southern Osaka, which remains the best place to sample this traditional street food. The skewers come in a number different flavours including offal and cartilage for the more adventurous. Most eateries offer a communal sweet tangy sauce but be sure to only dip your skewer once! It’s considered very rude to double dip.</p>

              <h3>Takoyaki (also known as “octopus balls”)</h3>
              <p>Takoyaki literally means “grilled octopus” and is a crowd favourite amongst Osakans. Street vendors combine the gloopy egg based batter with roughly cut slices of fresh octopus, pickled ginger and green onions and then spoon the mix into a special takoyaki pan which forms the batter into delectable sizzling spheres. Once cooked, the balls are drizzled with sweet takoyaki sauce and mayonnaise.</p>

              <h3>Yakiniku</h3>
              <p>Any connoisseur of meat knows Kobe beef is king. This special type of Japanese wagyu is one of the world’s best and comes from Kobe, a region located just 30 minutes by train from Osaka, which means it’s readily available. One of the best ways to enjoy Kobe beef is by Yakiniku, which is the Japanese style of cooking meat yourself on a charcoal grill in the middle of your table. The fat marbled mouth watering slices only need a few seconds on the grill and are so packed with flavours they don’t need any accompaniments.</p>

              <h3>Tessa</h3>
              <p>Osaka’s famous sashimi made from poisonous fugu, or globefish. It takes two years for chefs to earn the certification to be allowed to prepare the dangerous fish, which is designed to retain just enough poison to numb your lips! Although the dish is heavily regulated, be careful... the problematic puffer fish accounts for the majority of Japan’s food poisoning deaths, and results in around 40 hospitalisations a year!</p>
